# Flask_todo
The todo app is a application to add a todo list or a sticky notes.It is generally made up of python Flask framework and Semantic UI as frontend.
The app consists of title and text field where we want to add the title of the work or stuff we want to do. Once it is done, we can hit enter or add button to add the task to the list. The list generally shows up the update and delete. 
Once if we hit the update button, it shows the task as completed and if we hit it again, it works as vice versa. 
The delete button deletes the task from the list.
